## welcome to my cse repo!! 
it's worth noting that this was simply a means to store code i wrote for the mbot in my freshman year and lots of cleanup needs to be done.. 

### projects stored here include: 
- line following mBot (detecting black lines on white paper for navigation) 
- obstacle avoidance mBot (using sensors to detect obstacles)
- maze navigation mBot (using sensors + advanced decision-making to self-navigate a maze)
- singing mBot (song playback mBot paired with a tkinter window for song selection)
